Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to Steven or morla on

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
  so that users can not snoop on eachother. Files and directories with
  easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted!

  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /usr/local/gef/

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     This manual page documents version 5.30 of the [1mfile[0m command.[m
[m
     [1mfile[0m tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests,[m
     performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests, and language tests.  The [4mfirst[24m[m
     test that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.[m
[m
     The type printed will usually contain one of the words [4mtext[24m (the file contains only[m
     printing characters and a few common control characters and is probably safe to read[m
     on an ASCII terminal), [4mexecutable[24m (the file contains the result of compiling a program[m
     in a form understandable to some UNIX kernel or another), or [4mdata[24m meaning anything[m
     else (data is usually ‚Äúbinary‚Äù or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file for‚Äê[m
     mats (core files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When adding[m
     local definitions to /etc/magic, make sure to [4mpreserve[24m [4mthese[24m [4mkeywords[24m.  Users depend[m
     on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have the word ‚Äútext‚Äù printed.[m
     Don't do as Berkeley did and change ‚Äúshell commands text‚Äù to ‚Äúshell script‚Äù.[m
[m
     The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a stat(2) system call.[m
     The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's some sort of special file.[m
     Any known file types appropriate to the system you are running on (sockets, symbolic[m
     links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those systems that implement them) are intuited if[m
     they are defined in the system header file <[4msys/stat.h[24m>.[m
[m
     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.[m
     The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled program) a.out file,[m
     whose format is defined in <[4melf.h[24m>, <[4ma.out.h[24m> and possibly <[4mexec.h[24m> in the standard[m
     include directory.  These files have a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù stored in a particular place[m
     near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a[m
     binary executable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù has[m
     been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invariant identifier at a[m
     small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in this way.  The informa‚Äê[m
     tion identifying these files is read from /etc/magic and the compiled magic file[m
     [4m/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc[24m, or the files in the directory [4m/usr/share/misc/magic[24m if the[m
     compiled file does not exist.  In addition, if [4m$HOME/.magic.mgc[24m or [4m$HOME/.magic[24m[m
     exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files.[m
[m
     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see[m
     if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII char‚Äê[m
     acter sets (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Uni‚Äê[m
     code, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the[m
     different ranges and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.[m
     If a file passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII,[m
     ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as ‚Äútext‚Äù because they will[m
     be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only ‚Äúcharacter data‚Äù[m
     because, while they contain text, it is text that will require translation before it[m
     can be read.  In addition, [1mfile[0m will attempt to determine other characteristics of[m
     text-type files.  If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead[m
     of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that contain embedded escape[m
     sequences or overstriking will also be identified.[m
[m
     Once [1mfile[0m has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt[m
     to determine in what language the file is written.  The language tests look for par‚Äê[m
     ticular strings (cf.  <[4mnames.h[24m>) that can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a[m
     file.  For example, the keyword [4m.br[24m indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1)[m
     input file, just as the keyword [4mstruct[24m indicates a C program.  These tests are less[m
     reliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test[m
     routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).[m
[m
     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets[m
     listed above is simply said to be ‚Äúdata‚Äù.[m

[33;1H     links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those systems that implement them) are intuited if[m
[34;1H     they are defined in the system header file <[4msys/stat.h[24m>.[m
[35;1H[m
[36;1H     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.[m
[37;1H     The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled program) a.out file,[m
[38;1H     whose format is defined in <[4melf.h[24m>, <[4ma.out.h[24m> and possibly <[4mexec.h[24m> in the standard[m
[39;1H     include directory.  These files have a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù stored in a particular place[m
[40;1H     near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a[m
[41;1H     binary executable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù has[m
[42;1H     been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invariant identifier at a[m
[43;1H     small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in this way.  The informa‚Äê[m
[44;1H     tion identifying these files is read from /etc/magic and the compiled magic file[m
[45;1H     [4m/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc[24m, or the files in the directory [4m/usr/share/misc/magic[24m if the[m
[46;1H     compiled file does not exist.  In addition, if [4m$HOME/.magic.mgc[24m or [4m$HOME/.magic[24m[m
[47;1H     exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files.[m
[48;1H[m
[49;1H     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see[m
[50;1H     if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII char‚Äê[m
[51;1H     acter sets (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Uni‚Äê[m
[52;1H     code, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the[m
[53;1H     different ranges and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.[m
[54;1H     If a file passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII,[m
[55;1H     ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as ‚Äútext‚Äù because they will[m
[56;1H     be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only ‚Äúcharacter data‚Äù[m
[57;1H     because, while they contain text, it is text that will require translation before it[m
[58;1H     can be read.  In addition, [1mfile[0m will attempt to determine other characteristics of[m
[59;1H     text-type files.  If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead[m
[60;1H     of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that contain embedded escape[m
[61;1H     sequences or overstriking will also be identified.[m
[62;1H[m
[63;1H     Once [1mfile[0m has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt[m
[64;1H     to determine in what language the file is written.  The language tests look for par‚Äê[m
[65;1H     ticular strings (cf.  <[4mnames.h[24m>) that can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a[m
[66;1H     file.  For example, the keyword [4m.br[24m indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1)[m
[67;1H     input file, just as the keyword [4mstruct[24m indicates a C program.  These tests are less[m
[68;1H     reliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test[m
[69;1H     routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).[m
[70;1H[m
[71;1H     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets[m

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
     This manual page documents version 5.30 of the [1mfile[0m command.[m
[m
     [1mfile[0m tests each argument in an attempt to classify it.  There are three sets of tests,[m
     performed in this order: filesystem tests, magic tests, and language tests.  The [4mfirst[24m[m
     test that succeeds causes the file type to be printed.[m
[m
     The type printed will usually contain one of the words [4mtext[24m (the file contains only[m
     printing characters and a few common control characters and is probably safe to read[m
     on an ASCII terminal), [4mexecutable[24m (the file contains the result of compiling a program[m
     in a form understandable to some UNIX kernel or another), or [4mdata[24m meaning anything[m
     else (data is usually ‚Äúbinary‚Äù or non-printable).  Exceptions are well-known file for‚Äê[m
     mats (core files, tar archives) that are known to contain binary data.  When adding[m
     local definitions to /etc/magic, make sure to [4mpreserve[24m [4mthese[24m [4mkeywords[24m.  Users depend[m
     on knowing that all the readable files in a directory have the word ‚Äútext‚Äù printed.[m
     Don't do as Berkeley did and change ‚Äúshell commands text‚Äù to ‚Äúshell script‚Äù.[m
[m
     The filesystem tests are based on examining the return from a stat(2) system call.[m
     The program checks to see if the file is empty, or if it's some sort of special file.[m
     Any known file types appropriate to the system you are running on (sockets, symbolic[m
     links, or named pipes (FIFOs) on those systems that implement them) are intuited if[m
     they are defined in the system header file <[4msys/stat.h[24m>.[m
[m
     The magic tests are used to check for files with data in particular fixed formats.[m
     The canonical example of this is a binary executable (compiled program) a.out file,[m
     whose format is defined in <[4melf.h[24m>, <[4ma.out.h[24m> and possibly <[4mexec.h[24m> in the standard[m
     include directory.  These files have a ‚Äúmagic number‚Äù stored in a particular place[m
     near the beginning of the file that tells the UNIX operating system that the file is a[m
     binary executable, and which of several types thereof.  The concept of a ‚Äúmagic‚Äù has[m
     been applied by extension to data files.  Any file with some invariant identifier at a[m
     small fixed offset into the file can usually be described in this way.  The informa‚Äê[m
     tion identifying these files is read from /etc/magic and the compiled magic file[m
     [4m/usr/share/misc/magic.mgc[24m, or the files in the directory [4m/usr/share/misc/magic[24m if the[m
     compiled file does not exist.  In addition, if [4m$HOME/.magic.mgc[24m or [4m$HOME/.magic[24m[m
     exists, it will be used in preference to the system magic files.[m
[m
     If a file does not match any of the entries in the magic file, it is examined to see[m
     if it seems to be a text file.  ASCII, ISO-8859-x, non-ISO 8-bit extended-ASCII char‚Äê[m
     acter sets (such as those used on Macintosh and IBM PC systems), UTF-8-encoded Uni‚Äê[m
     code, UTF-16-encoded Unicode, and EBCDIC character sets can be distinguished by the[m
     different ranges and sequences of bytes that constitute printable text in each set.[m
     If a file passes any of these tests, its character set is reported.  ASCII,[m
     ISO-8859-x, UTF-8, and extended-ASCII files are identified as ‚Äútext‚Äù because they will[m
     be mostly readable on nearly any terminal; UTF-16 and EBCDIC are only ‚Äúcharacter data‚Äù[m
     because, while they contain text, it is text that will require translation before it[m
     can be read.  In addition, [1mfile[0m will attempt to determine other characteristics of[m
     text-type files.  If the lines of a file are terminated by CR, CRLF, or NEL, instead[m
     of the Unix-standard LF, this will be reported.  Files that contain embedded escape[m
     sequences or overstriking will also be identified.[m
[m
     Once [1mfile[0m has determined the character set used in a text-type file, it will attempt[m
     to determine in what language the file is written.  The language tests look for par‚Äê[m
     ticular strings (cf.  <[4mnames.h[24m>) that can appear anywhere in the first few blocks of a[m
     file.  For example, the keyword [4m.br[24m indicates that the file is most likely a troff(1)[m
     input file, just as the keyword [4mstruct[24m indicates a C program.  These tests are less[m
     reliable than the previous two groups, so they are performed last.  The language test[m
     routines also test for some miscellany (such as tar(1) archives).[m
[m
     Any file that cannot be identified as having been written in any of the character sets[m
     listed above is simply said to be ‚Äúdata‚Äù.[m
