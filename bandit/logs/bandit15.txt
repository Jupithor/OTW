Welcome to OverTheWire!

If you find any problems, please report them to Steven or morla on

--[ Playing the games ]--

  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:

    * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
    * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
    * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.

  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ and /proc/ is disabled
  so that users can not snoop on eachother. Files and directories with
  easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted!

  Please play nice:

    * don't leave orphan processes running
    * don't leave exploit-files laying around
    * don't annoy other players
    * don't post passwords or spoilers
    * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
      This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!

--[ Tips ]--

  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:

    -m32                    compile for 32bit
    -fno-stack-protector    disable ProPolice
    -Wl,-z,norelro          disable relro

  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.

  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.

--[ Tools ]--

 For your convenience we have installed a few usefull tools which you can find
 in the following locations:

    * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /usr/local/gef/
    * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /usr/local/pwndbg/
    * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /usr/local/peda/
    * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /usr/local/gdbinit/
    * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
    * radare2 (http://www.radare.org/)
    * checksec.sh (http://www.trapkit.de/tools/checksec.html) in /usr/local/bin/checksec.sh

[m
[1mDESCRIPTION[0m[m
       [1mnetcat[0m  is  a simple unix utility which reads and writes data across network connec‐[m
       tions, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a  reliable  "back-end"  tool[m
       that  can  be  used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the[m
       same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can[m
       create  almost  any  kind  of  connection you would need and has several interesting[m
       built-in capabilities.  Netcat, or "nc" as the actual program is named, should  have[m
       been supplied long ago as another one of those cryptic but standard Unix tools.[m
[m
       In  the simplest usage, "nc host port" creates a TCP connection to the given port on[m
       the given target host.  Your standard input is then sent to the host,  and  anything[m
       that comes back across the connection is sent to your standard output.  This contin‐[m
       ues indefinitely, until the network side of the connection shuts  down.   Note  that[m
       this  behavior  is different from most other applications which shut everything down[m
       and exit after an end-of-file on the standard input.[m
[m
       Netcat can also function as a server, by listening for inbound connections on  arbi‐[m
       trary  ports  and  then doing the same reading and writing.  With minor limitations,[m
       netcat doesn't really care if it runs in "client" or "server" mode -- it still shov‐[m
       els  data  back  and forth until there isn't any more left. In either mode, shutdown[m
       can be forced after a configurable time of inactivity on the network side.[m
[m
       And it can do this via UDP too, so netcat is possibly the "udp telnet-like" applica‐[m
       tion  you always wanted for testing your UDP-mode servers.  UDP, as the "U" implies,[m
       gives less reliable data transmission than TCP connections and some systems may have[m
       trouble  sending  large amounts of data that way, but it's still a useful capability[m
       to have.[m
[m
       You may be asking "why not just use telnet to connect  to  arbitrary  ports?"  Valid[m
       question,  and  here are some reasons.  Telnet has the "standard input EOF" problem,[m
       so one must introduce calculated delays in driving scripts to allow  network  output[m
       to  finish.   This  is the main reason netcat stays running until the *network* side[m
       closes.  Telnet also will not transfer arbitrary binary data, because certain  char‐[m
       acters  are interpreted as telnet options and are thus removed from the data stream.[m
       Telnet also emits some of its diagnostic messages to standard output,  where  netcat[m
       keeps  such things religiously separated from its *output* and will never modify any[m
       of the real data in transit unless you *really* want it to.  And of course telnet is[m
       incapable  of  listening  for  inbound  connections,  or  using UDP instead.  Netcat[m

[m
       The [1mopenssl[0m program is a command line tool for using the various cryptography[m
       functions of OpenSSL's [1mcrypto[0m library from the shell.  It can be used for[m
[m
        o  Creation and management of private keys, public keys and parameters[m
        o  Public key cryptographic operations[m
        o  Creation of X.509 certificates, CSRs and CRLs[m

[1mCOMMAND[0m [1mSUMMARY[0m[m
       The [1mopenssl[0m program provides a rich variety of commands ([4mcommand[24m in the SYNOPSIS[m
       above), each of which often has a wealth of options and arguments ([4mcommand_opts[24m and[m
       [4mcommand_args[24m in the SYNOPSIS).[m
[m
       Many commands use an external configuration file for some or all of their arguments[m
       and have a [1m-config[0m option to specify that file.  The environment variable[m
       [1mOPENSSL_CONF[0m can be used to specify the location of the file.  If the environment[m
       variable is not specified, then the file is named [1mopenssl.cnf[0m in the default[m
       certificate storage area, whose value depends on the configuration flags specified[m
       when the OpenSSL was built.[m
[m
       The list parameters [1mstandard-commands[0m, [1mdigest-commands[0m, and [1mcipher-commands[0m output a[m
       list (one entry per line) of the names of all standard commands, message digest[m
       commands, or cipher commands, respectively, that are available in the present[m
